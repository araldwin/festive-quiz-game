The website is created with the intention of bringing joy, merriment, and a sprinkle of festive magic into the digital world. Its aim is to allow users to fully immerse themselves in the Christmas spirit through a specially curated Christmas Fun Quiz.
The purpose of the website is to provide users with a way to take a break from their daily routine. The quiz on the website is an ideal way for users to unwind, relax, and refresh their minds during the holiday season. It offers users a chance to test their knowledge of Christmas traditions, history, and pop culture in a fun, interactive, and enjoyable way.


## Objectives


  - The main goal of the player is to assist Santa in delivering gifts to children from the North Pole by answering Christmas-related questions. For every correct answer, Santa moves closer to his final destination. The quiz consists of three levels of difficulty - Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each level has a different number of attempts, and the user will experience a unique end animation when they successfully complete each level.

Whether they are on the go or have some free time, this game is a great way to unwind from their usual busy routine and enjoy the holiday season. It's perfect for those who want to take a break and have some fun while celebrating Christmas and its traditions.

  It is designed for everyone who loves to celebrate Christmas and its traditions, the game is made available and accessible at users' fingertips, wherever they go. It helps users have the feeling that itâ€™s time to get into the Christmas spirit and have some fun!

  By carefully considering the needs of the users for Christmas, the team crafted the website that boasts a visually striking design, sure to captivate and entice visitors to keep having fun interacting with the website.


## Initial Concept

### Wireframes

  - The design of the website was a collaborative effort from the team assigned to build  it. Different ideas were suggested on where each content should be placed on the page. As a result, the team decided to have different designs, which may have subtle changes as the building progresses.

## Design

### Color Scheme

<img src="assets/readme.docs/Color Hunt Palette c21010e64848fffde3cfe8a9.png" width="500" alt="image of color palette">

In order for users to fully immerse themselves in the moment and the season, we have chosen colors that reflect the themes of love and harmony, as well as the festive atmosphere of Christmas. Our color palette includes a variety of shades that capture these feelings and emotions. The colors are: Venetian Red, Carmine Pink, Light Yellow, and Menthol.
These colors are all reflected in the background image.



### Typography

- #### Background
  A background image with Christmas theme was added to the webpage to give a 3D effect and make the heading area look more interactive. The homepage features an animated background theme with a woodfire effect to create a cozy and warm atmosphere of Christmas.
  As users might expect, they want to feel immersed in the Christmas atmosphere, so the team opted for a background that is visually appealing and gives the right impression.


- #### Fonts

  - Berkshire Swash font

  The chosen fonts for the website were imported using Google Fonts.
  
  After careful consideration, the team decided to use the fonts Caveat, Rubik Doodle Shadow and Berkshire Swash for the text on screens of all sizes. We believe that these fonts offer a great combination of aesthetic appeal and readability, and will help to enhance the overall user experience.
